# Sahara-Auberge
Sahara Auberge is a hostel website, it is divided into two parts:
  + The customer part:
    In this part there is the index page where we present all the information concerning the hostel (its services, its activities, visitors' opinions,
    the gallery, the rooms and prices, the newsletters and contact). And I don't forget the reservation page where you can reserve rooms if they are available.
  + The administration part of the hostel:
    In this part, the admin has the possibility to see all reserved rooms and new reservations (Status),
    to send newsletters, print invoicing (Payment) and profits from the hostel.
We used html, css, js, bootstrap and php/mysql in this website.
